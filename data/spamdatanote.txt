The set contains text data. First you have to transform text data in numerical data
(discover how).

Target Variable to predicted: "class" (in the training set)
Two classes: "spam" and "ham" 

The folder contains three datasets:

learning data: about 80% of the units of the original dataset
test data: about 20% of the units of the original dataset

The test set does not contain the target variable. The true values of the target variable will be discussed during the exam.

Model the train data according to the logistic regression and provide the file of the test data with the predicted values
